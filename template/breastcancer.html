              Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. 

Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.

Itâ€™s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care professional to determine if it is benign or malignant.

    <p class="card-text" style="color:black; font-family: righteous;"> 
      Symptoms of breast tumors vary from person to person. Some common, early warning signs of breast cancer include: <br>
<ul style="font-family:righteous">
    <li>Skin changes, such as swelling, redness, or other visible differences in one or both breasts</li>
    <li>An increase in size or change in shape of the breast(s) </li>
    <li>General pain in/on any part of the breast</li>
    <li>Lumps or nodes felt on or inside of the breast </li> </ul>
              
      Invasive breast cancer symptoms may include: <br>
      <br>
<ul style="font-family: righteous;">
<li>A lump or mass in the breast </li>
    <li>Swelling of all or part of the breast, even if no lump is felt</li>
    <li>Skin irritation or dimpling </li> </ul>

    <p class="card-text">
        
        
       Research shows that lifestyle changes can decrease the risk of breast cancer, even in women at high risk. To lower your risk: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Limit alcohol: The more alcohol you drink, the greater your risk of developing breast cancer. The general recommendation is to limit yourself to less than one drink a day, as even small amounts increase risk.</li> <br>
    <li>Don't smoke: Evidence suggests a link between smoking and breast cancer risk.</li><br>
    <li>Control your weight :Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer. This is especially true if obesity occurs later in life, particularly after menopause.</li> <br>

    <h5 class="card-title" style="text-align: center; color: maroon">TREATMENTS</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      
      Some treatments remove or destroy the disease within the breast and nearby tissues, such as lymph nodes. These include:
<ul>
    <li>Surgery: Surgery to remove the whole breast, called a mastectomy, or to remove just the tumor called a lumpectomy </li>
    <li>Radiation therapy: It uses high-energy waves to kill cancer cells. </li>  

    <li>Chemotherapy: Chemo uses drugs to kill cancer cells. As these powerful medicines fight the disease, they also can cause side effects ike nausea, hair loss, early menopause, hot flashes, and fatigue. </li>

    <li>Hormone therapy uses drugs to prevent hormones, especially estrogen, from fueling the growth of breast cancer cells. </li>
